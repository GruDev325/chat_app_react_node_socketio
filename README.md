# Take-Home Assignment
The focus will be on code that is well-tested, readable, and maintainable. We will interact through
pull requests and possibly have a call to discuss the decisions you made as well as work on minor
improvements. 
### The purpose of this assignment is:
1. To give you the freedom to code in your most natural environment since we believe in-person
sessions or whiteboard coding don’t always reflect our coding skills
2. To see the kind of code you would produce if you were to work with us
3. To create flexibility in scheduling interviews because you may choose to do this assignment
in the nights or over the weekends.
## Restrictions
Please choose from the options below, based on the role you’re interviewing for:
### 1. Front-End:
The only requirement is that you use "React" in your tech stack. The rest is up to you to decide. If
you are a Front-end developer only, you can complete only the front-end features
### 2. Back-End:
The only requirement is that you use "NodeJS" in your tech stack. The rest is up to you to decide.
You can complete only the back-end features if you are a Backend developer. 
### 3. Full-Stack:
Must meet BOTH of the criteria from Front-end and Back-end sections. You must complete at least
one of each front-end and back-end features.
## Assignment Details
Pick and implement as many of the features from below, while keeping in mind the objective is to
create well tested, readable, and maintainable code. By no means do we expect you to complete all
a ton of the features listed below, so pick the ones that interest you the most.
Try to focus more on fully developed features rather than the number of features. The principles we
are looking for are not tied up to the amount of code, but rather to the quality of it.

## Deliverables:
```
1. A link to a git repo with the working code in it
2. Instructions on how to run the code so we can check it out ourselves
3. Few words on which features were selected and why?
4. Possible next steps if you had more time. What assumptions did you make?
```
